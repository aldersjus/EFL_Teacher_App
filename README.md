This application was created a few years ago. It is a record system fo EFL teachers to monitor the progress of the 
students and the lessons taken by them. It was one of my first Android applications, so the code is a little rough 
around the edges. However, it works without any issues. This app has spent a few years on the Google Play store with 
mild success. I learnt a lot from the creation of this app, the complete process of being an app developer.
