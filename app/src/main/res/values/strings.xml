        \n\nOrganize your classes, mark off your lessons and track your students progress.
        \nThis app has been created with ease of use in mind. It uses your favorite Android navigation style/, just open the drawer to reveal all your options, everything is just one click away.
        It has been designed for EFL/ESL/ELT teachers on the go! Use this as a quick reference to ensure you never teach the same lesson twice(unless your students need it).
        You can create lesson files and student files. These can be used to track the lessons youâ€™ve taught and to monitor your students progress by adding comments to their files. You can grade your students, grammar, vocabulary, listening, fluency and communicative ability. Dates are appended to lesson reports to keep track of when lessons were taught(year/month/day format).
        Take a picture of your student to ensure you never forget a face. App uses the built in camera application to do this.
        All you need to know is displayed in the lesson and student reports for your convenience.\n\nAll app functions can be selected by using the navigation drawer for phones and 7 inch tablets. To access the drawer, please touch the
        three bars on the left hand side of the action bar at the top of the screen. For 10 inch tablets please use the list to access functions. We hope this app is
        useful for you and you have a trouble free experience.
